Android Strings Xml &lt;-> CSV converter

Tool for generating csv file from android strings. Used for exporting/importing translations to/from "client friendly" xlsx.

Support for multiple languages exists as but may require adding more languege codes to source code.

Limitted to supporting;
```xml
<string>
<string-array>
<plurals>
```

Maybe ugly, but it works.
